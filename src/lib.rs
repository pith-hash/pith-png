//! PNG decoding (ISO/IEC 15948, W3C PNG specification): every colour type,
//! 1/2/4/8/16-bit depths, all five row filters and Adam7 interlacing,
//! into the suite's shared [`Image`] buffers.
//!
//! Part of the `pith` zero-dependency hashing suite: every crate depends
//! only on other `pith-*` crates plus `std`, so the whole suite resolves
//! without a single registry package.
//!
//! Decode produces `u8` pixels for PNG files coded at 8 bits (and for the
//! sub-8-bit greyscale and indexed depths, which the specification defines
//! in terms of 8-bit output) and `u16` pixels for the 16-bit codings, big
//!-endian as PNG stores them. Colour types without a matching
//! [`Layout`](pith_image::raster::Layout) expand to the smallest layout that
//! carries them losslessly: greyscale+alpha becomes `Rgba`, a `tRNS`
//! transparency on greyscale or truecolour produces `Rgba`, and indexed
//! colour is looked up through the `PLTE` palette (plus `tRNS` alpha) into
//! `Rgb`/`Rgba`.
//!
//! The stream is checked, not skimmed: every chunk CRC-32 is verified
//! ([`pith_digest::crc32`]), `IDAT` bytes inflate through
//! [`pith_inflate`], chunk ordering rules (`IHDR` first, `PLTE`/`tRNS`
//! before `IDAT`, consecutive `IDAT`s, `IEND` last) are enforced, and any
//! violation is a named [`Error`], never a panic or a guess.
//!
//! A minimal encoder ([`encode`]) exists **only** so the test suite can
//! round-trip: it writes non-interlaced zlib streams of stored DEFLATE
//! blocks, one filter per file. It is test scaffolding, not a compressor.
//!
//! The crate is `no_std` apart from the `alloc` [`Vec`] its API
//! returns; the `std` feature (on by default) links `std` so the
//! `cdylib` the language SDKs bind through carries a panic handler.

#![cfg_attr(not(feature = "std"), no_std)]
// `unsafe` is denied everywhere except `ffi`, the C ABI surface the
// language SDKs bind through: raw pointers exist only at that boundary,
// and every exported function is a documented `unsafe extern "C"` fn.
